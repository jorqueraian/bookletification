# bookletification
Makes booklets out of pdfs

Running the code `python bookletify.py` will give you input options

```
It seems like you need help!
bookletify <input pdf file> [page scaling = 1.1]
```
with the page scaling being optional.

To run the code do the following
```python bookletify.py file.pdf```

See `mini-booklet-Who_Framed_Matroid_Rabbit.pdf` for an example of the output

When printing, print double sided with the option that flips pages on the short edge!
